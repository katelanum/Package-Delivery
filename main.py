# Take in the package data and put that information in Package objects

# Take package objects and populate HashTable

# Create adjacency list of nodes

# Dijkstra's
# Create a set to keep track of nodes in shortest path tree

# Set of nodes not yet in tree

# Assign distances with original being huge, 0 distance for starting node

# While set of included nodes doesn't have all the nodes

# Pick unincluded node with lowest distance value

# Add that node to the list of included nodes

# Update distance value of all adjacent nodes
# Iterate through all adjacent nodes

# If the distance from the current node is lower than the current distance, update the distance value

# Populate truck package list

# Populate truck map/path

# Truck status
# Leverage time, then traverse truck graph for that time

# Package status
# Check package status field
